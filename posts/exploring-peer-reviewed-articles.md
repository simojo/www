- In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

The goals of this article is to discuss the leading methods of quantum image representation and detection. By leveraging properties of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, there are algorithms that have been developed to use probabilities of qubit states. These methods are compared and contrasted and their efficiencies and feasibility are made mention of.


- What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

The general task is quantum image processing.

- What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

One of the leading methods of quantum image storage is using a qubit lattice, in which there exists the same number of qubits as pixels in the image. Each qubit's probability densities are mapped and pinned to information about that pixel. For example, the probability of an electron being a radial distance $r$ away from the atom, the probability of an electron being at a certain angle along some axis $\theta$, and the probability of an electron being at a certain angle along some axis $\phi$ would each correspond to an analogue value of color or intensity.

A leading form of image edge detection is to perform a mathematical transformation on an atom's energy states that returns the gradient $(\nabla)$ of the intensities using the probability densities. Areas where this gradient is sharpest will dictate where a possible edge may lie. The beauty of this is just how much information is being stored in a fundamental building block of nature. The density of information this has implications for is fascinating. The classical transistor has dimensions around $0.25\times10^{-6}$m while an atom has a dimension of around $1\times10^{-15}$m. This is ten orders of magnitude smaller!

- What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

These demonstrations apply to the field of computer engineering, quantum computing, and spintronics. They are simply reviewing theoretical, math-based algorithms that have been constructed around storing quantum information for image representation, which is a great impetus for better storage solutions.

- How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?

I could derive a better algorithm with which to store things using quantum superposition and probability densities. This may give me existing methods for quantum storage that will allow me to open my eyes to what has already been accomplished.

- What is the goal of this article?

The goal of this article is to show the effectiveness of a robotic system that has notable traction control.

- In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

The goal of this article is to review the success of the design of a robotic system capable of navigating variable terrain with high levels of traction. They describe the algorithm that they created that can estimate the contact angle of each tire of the robot so that it is able to maintain static friction on each wheel as it scales objects such as a staircase or a short wall. Each wheel operates off of its own independent coordinate system which allows it to have enhanced traction control. Additionally, the chassis of the robotic vehicle is designed to provide each wheel with an optimal contact angle that allows for the most traction, similarly to how a moon buggy is designed.

 - What is the goal of this article?

The goal of this article is to propose a transparent holographic imaging system.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

This article discusses a volumetric holographic optical element (VHOE) that creates an image on a transparent surface. The image is formed using two plates of glass that control the beams of light entering it so that the image projected onto it appears in full color 'floating' in mid air. The result was that they were able to image a jellyfish between two sheets of transparent glass. Their gesture towards the future of this research was that this technology has implications in augmented reality an heads up displays (HUDs). Although they were able to successfully image what they desired, they recognize that their holographic system could use improvement in how it creates an image, being that it depends on a projection to be cast to it.
