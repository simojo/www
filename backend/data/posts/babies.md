# Babies

Babies are soft, and cuddly,
babies are warm and sweet.
There is nothing like the sound,
of the pitter,patter of tiny feet.
You listen patiently, for the first word,
watch them as they rapidly grow.
But soon they will get older,
you won't want to let them go.

As you go, through troubled times,
and life's worries make you weep.
The world will seem much brighter,
because this baby is your's to keep.
