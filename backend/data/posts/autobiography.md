### 2022-03-09

My name is Simon Jones, I am currently studying physics and computer science at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA. I live in Townville, PA, a small town roughly a half hour east of Meadville. I went to a small Christian school just a short walk from campus.

My hobbies include playing the piano, backpacking, coaching soccer, latte making, and producing music with my friends.
