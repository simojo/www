## Python module that Converts YouTube videos into comic books
### 24 11 2020

Being a frequent user of YouTube, I created a program to turn YouTube videos into a comic books for my CMPSC 100 course project. It's implemented in python and uses a couple of libraries to get things such as the video title, closed captioning, and to work with images and videos.

The closed captioning processing is comically weak, but it still grabs contextual tidbits of sentences and hacks it into a sentence. I also tried to implement my own posterizing algorithm, but, for some reason, it produces an overly green/yellow/brown/red image each time; still posterized, but not properly.
