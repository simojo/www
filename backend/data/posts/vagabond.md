Last night I saw the silhouette of my long lost soul
sitting on top of the world
sanpaku eyes silently speaking of a burning world
brilliantly glowing, shrapnel shooting in every direction

Air of revoloution emanating from its roughed up core
full of windy smiles and tales never heard

It struck me like a baseball bat with its emancipating loneliness
shattering confusion with a shure swing
unknowingly shaking me out of my deep sleep
setting heaps of charcoal ablaze in my dead sanctum
propelling me into the air feeling refreshed

In a flurry of thoughts bombarding me, I stand tall, ignited
swiftly adjusting to the lightness of my ship - anchors discarded
I remember this place, it was my home
