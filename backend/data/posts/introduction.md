# Introduction
## An introduction of my research interests and academic draws.
### 2022-03-09

Initially, before coming to college, my academic interest centered around electrical and computer engineering. I loved soldering and wiring up circuit boards, but I had never programmed. This all changed after I met two people that steered me into enjoying computer science. Computer science drew me in because of its accessibility of education and resources and how much it can empower us. In order to preserve my interests in electrical and computer engineering and calculus, I added a physics major.

Through taking undergraduate classes I have formed my research interest to be within the areas of electrical and engineering, robotics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and quantum computing. Projects that enable people with disabilities or empower them in their day to day lives are most appealing to me. The problem with this is that most peer-reviewed journals I find do not speak of products that are engineered. I have had a very hard time finding articles that relate exactly to my area of academic interest for this reason.

I would like to research something that can break into a new paradigm of computing, a development that creates smaller and faster computers that leverage the power of photon entanglement and the speed of light to operate many orders of magnitude faster than traditional Von-Neumann architecture computers. Research like this would involve a thorough understanding of photonics and quantum physics as well as an extensive background in computer engineering. While I do not have these backgrounds, I hope to pursue something similar to this in graduate school.
