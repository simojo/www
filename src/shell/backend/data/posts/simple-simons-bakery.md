A frothy haven of godly profanity
Whose customers daily question their sanity

Puff pastries invaded by sheer perspicuities
Confections layered in sweet ambiguities

Fat doughnuts blithely unencumbered by holes
Tart filling, quite chilling observational goals

His bread is a heart-crusted pumpernickel
To nurture the winsome, confound the fickle

Whatever your taste is, English muffin or strudel
He's always got something to tickle your noodle

But if you're pun stubborn and stick to your gun
He'll give you a taste of his cinnamon bun
