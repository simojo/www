the u.s. is-                cuba is

not                         my home,

my fair scapegoat.          i know

shame                       when i look

my spoiled complicity       in clean glass,

in all its patriot blush,   its brown skin sheen,

and behold our life,        see me;

seed of bilateral strife.   look out

and underneath              the island’s windows,

your town’s gravel,         inside your shops, i’m there,

i intervene                 too
