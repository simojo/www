# Parable Life

Isn't life a parable

The grandest tree of all
And like peaches falling

Falling in the fall

The scratched color purple

The purple on its back
And like a dark rainbow

Reindeers locked in racks

Isn't life a parable

Panorama on a wall
And like a breath is taken

Taken by the fall
